                  <p>An introduction to the inner workings of the Internet, starting at the beginning with the first Ethernet networks at Xerox PARC and finishing with the latest developments in the world of Web. A bit of history, some standards, some examples and live demos. This will be followed by a tour of the Electronics Research Group's datacenter in Fraser Noble building.<br>CIf you've ever wondered the difference between a network router and a network switch, how flows on the Internet carry data reliably and with minimum delay or how the protocol behind the Web work in the real world, come along and find some answers to your questions.</p>

                    <p>At this workshop you'll learn the fundamental concepts of high-level networking relevant to set up a basic web server at home, including TCP/IP, DNS, and NAT. You'll also get instruction on how to get yourself a domain name, link it to a dynamic DNS service and then forward the required port(s) through NAT (the IP address translation that most consumer IPv4 routers use). You can bring your own Raspberry Pi, but we'll provide some Pi's and equipment so you can have a go at some of the concepts yourself. <strong>Please bring along your laptop if you have one.</strong></p>
